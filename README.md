## Overview

**_Making Go come to functional programming._**

This is a research project in functional programming which I hope will prove useful!

**ƒ**___uego___ brings a few functional paradigms to Go. The intent is to save development time while promoting code readability and reduce the risk of complex bugs.

I hope you will find it useful!

Have fun!!

## Documentation

The code documentation and some examples can be found on [godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/seborama/fuego).

The tests form the best source of documentation. **ƒ**___uego___ comes with a good collection of unit tests and testable Go examples. Don't be shy, open them up and read them and tinker with them!

**Note:**
<br/>
Most tests use unbuffered channels to help detect deadlocks. In real life scenarios, it is recommended to use buffered channels for increased performance.

## Installation

### Download

```bash
go get github.com/seborama/fuego
```

Or for a specific version:

```bash
go get gopkg.in/seborama/fuego.v7
```

### Import in your code

You can import the package in the usua Go fashiom.

To simplify usage, you can use an alias:

```go
package sample

import ƒ "gopkg.in/seborama/fuego.v7"
```

or import as an unqualified dot import:

```go
package sample

import . "gopkg.in/seborama/fuego.v7"
```

## Example Stream

```go
    strs := EntrySlice{
        EntryString("a"),
        EntryString("bb"),
        EntryString("cc"),
        EntryString("ddd"),
    }
    
    NewStreamFromSlice(strs, 500).
        Filter(isEntryString).
        Distinct().
        Collect(
            GroupingBy(
                stringLength,
                Mapping(
                    stringToUpper,
                    Filtering(
                        stringLengthGreaterThan(1),
                        ToEntrySlice()))))
    }

    // result: map[1:[] 2:[BB CC] 3:[DDD]]
```

## Contributions

Contributions and feedback are welcome.

For contributions, you must develop in TDD fashion and ideally provide Go testable examples (if meaningful).

If you have an idea to improve **ƒ**___uego___, please share it via an issue. And if you like **ƒ**___uego___ give it a star to show your support for the project - it will put a smile on my face! :blush:

Thanks!!

## The Golden rules of the game

1. Producers close their channel. In other words, when you create a channel, you are responsible for closing it. Similarly, whenever **ƒ**___uego___ creates a channel, it is responsible for closing it.

1. Consumers do not close channels.

1. Producers and consumers should be running in separate Go routines to prevent deadlocks when the channels' buffers fill up.

[(toc)](#table-of-content)

## Pressure

Go channels support buffering that affects the behaviour when combining channels in a pipeline.

When the buffer of a Stream's channel of a consumer  is full, the producer will not be able to send more data through to it. This protects downstream operations from overloading.

Presently, a Go channel cannot dynamically change its buffer size. This prevents from adapting the stream flexibly. Constructs that use 'select' on channels on the producer side can offer opportunities for mitigation.

## Concept: Entry

`Entry` is inspired by `hamt.Entry`. This is an elegant solution from [Yota Toyama](https://github.com/raviqqe): the type can be anything so long as it respects the simple behaviour of the`Entry` interface. This provides an abstraction of types yet with known behaviour:

- Hash(): identifies an Entry Uniquely.
- Equal(): defines equality for a concrete type of `Entry`. `Equal()` is expected to be based on `Hash()` for non-basic types. Equal should ensure the compared Entry is of the same type as the reference Entry. For instance, `EntryBool(false)` and `EntryInt(0)` both have a Hash of `0`, yet they aren't equal.

Several Entry implementations are provided:

- EntryBool
- EntryInt
- EntryFloat
- EntryString
- EntryMap
- EntrySlice
- Tuples

Check the [godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/seborama/fuego) for additional methods each of these may provide.

### Concurrency

Concurrent streams are challenging to implement owing to ordering issues in parallel processing. At the moment, the view is that the most sensible approach is to delegate control to users. Multiple **ƒ**___uego___ streams can be created and data distributed across as desired. This empowers users of **ƒ**___uego___ to implement the desired behaviour of their pipelines.

`Stream` has some methods that fan out (e.g. `ForEachC`). See the [godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/seborama/fuego) for further information and limitations.

I recommend Rob Pike's slides on Go concurrency patterns:

- [Go Concurrency Patterns, Rob Pike, 2012](https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#1)

## Collectors

A `Collector` is a mutable reduction operation, optionally transforming the accumulated result.

Collectors can be combined to express complex operations in a concise manner.

In other words, a collector allows creating custom actions on a Stream. **ƒ**___uego___ comes shipped with a number of methods such as `MapToInt`, `Head`, `LastN`, `Filter`, etc, and Collectors also provide a few additional methods. But what if you need something else? And it is not straighforward or readable when combining the existing methods **ƒ**___uego___ offers? Enters `Collector`: implement you own requirement functionally! Focus on _**what**_ needs to be done in your streams (and delegate the details of the _**how**_ to the implementation of your `Collector`).

It should be noted that the `finisher` function is optional (i.e. it may acceptably be `nil`).

## Known limitations

- several operations may be memory intensive or poorly performing.
